# python-cleanup-of-dropbox
This program removes files from a Dropbox app which are older than 10 days.

This program assists in the housekeeping of Dropbox in relation to another program I wrote which saves the files to Dropbox in the first place < https://github.com/tpmccallum/bitnami-wordpress-backup-to-dropbox >

Before running this program I make sure that the server time (on which the script is run) is correct, because the program compares the Dropbox modified time and the loca server time to determine 10 days old!

NOTE: This program is for use when you are trying to clear out older files from Dropbox automatically, please take caution as running this program will delete your files.

If I get time I would like to have the program remove the unwanted files in the order of oldest to newest and in addition build in a base number of files to retain (preventing all files being removed if there is an unnoticed issue with the backup script which putsÂ the files into Dropbox in the first place).
